# Titanleg Design EKLAVYA 2023
We are working on titan legs design, This project is concerned with creating, testing, and controlling a quadrupedal leg. We'll be understanding mathematical and kinematical ideas for effective mechanisms, aslo we'll be reviewing past designs of a quadruped leg and then designing our own version. Many quadruped projects like the MIT Cheetah, Stanford doggo, IISCstoch have been made, the research Papers published on these robots will he studies thoroughly for analysis and design aspects.
