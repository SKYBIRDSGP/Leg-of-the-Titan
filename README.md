# TITANLEG DESIGN EKLAVYA 2023

## About the Project
This project aims towards the design and the development of the robotic legs, and testing the same against the environmental constraints(different terrains), the Torque bearing capacity, the load as well as the shock bearing capabilities of the legs of a Quadruped Robot. So basically designing, manufacturing, testing, and controlling of leg for a quadruped is to be done in this Project.  

##  **What** is **a** **Quadruped** **Robot** **?**
**Normally**, wheels are used for the motion of any bot.But in a Quadruped bot,we use robotic legs for the motion of the bot. A Quadruped Robot is a robot, and as the name says, it has 4 legs to help the robot perform various gait activities and ultimately help the bot achieve translational or rotational motion of the Robot.  
   Quadruped robots have a better stability towards any kind of terrain and are more robust as compared to the typical wheeled robots. The legs of the robot provide us a greater stability even on uneven surfaces and they also have capability of restanding after toppling. They are highly energy efficient and versatile. There are a lot many advantages of the Quadruped Robots, like high load capacity, Payload capacity, and also there is a wide range of its applications, like in construction, delivery and transport, industrial inspections, Military & Defense, exploration etc..

## The Flow of the project :

First the basic concepts of the project needs to be cleared. Quadrupped is advantageous, but how can we approach and make it? What are the pre-preparation for the same?  
 We just need to undergo the previous researchs on the Quadraped Robots, have a basic understanding of the mechanisms we need to drive the upper and lower leg links, get abbduction as well as adduction , have a basic knowledge of materials ,the Leg modelling and simulations as well.
 Then comes the manufacture part and the various tests (No worries, will cover up section by section and level up).
